A The title of the homework and the author names (you and 
your partner)

B The purpose of the program
C Acknowledgements for any help you received, including 
references to outside sources you

consulted (though there is no need list C++ references like
cplusplus.com).

D The files that you provided and a short description of what 
each file is and its purpose

E How to compile and run your program
F An “architectural overview,” i.e., a description of how your 
various program modules relate.

For example, the FSTree implementation keeps a pointer to the 
root DirNode.

G An outline of the data structures and algorithms that you used.
Given that this is a data structures class, you need to always 
discuss any data structures that you used and justify why you 
used them. For this assignment it is imperative that you explain 
your data structures and algorithms in detail, as it will help us 
understand your code since there is no single right way of 
completing this assignment.

H Details and an explanation of how you tested the various parts 
of your classes and the program as a whole. You may reference the 
testing files that you submitted to aid in your explanation.

I. Please let us know approximately how many hours you spent 
working  on this project. This should include both weeks one and
two.
